Certainly! I'll explain the steps of this complex pipeline in a markdown format. Here's how we can structure the explanation:

# Advanced Pipeline Example

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to leverage various parts of the Framework3 to create a sophisticated pipeline. This pipeline combines caching, parallel feature generation, and stacked classifiers.

## Pipeline Structure

```python
pipeline = F3Pipeline(
    plugins=[
        MapReduceFeatureExtractorPipeline(
            app_name='quick_start',
            filters=[
                Cached(
                    filter=F3Pipeline(
                        plugins=[
                            StandardScalerPlugin(),
                            PCAPlugin(n_components=2),
                            ClassifierSVMPlugin()
                        ],
                        metrics=[F1(), Precission(), Recall()]
                    ),
                    cache_data=True,
                    cache_filter=True,
                    overwrite=True
                ),

                F3Pipeline(plugins=[
                    StandardScalerPlugin(),
                    PCAPlugin(n_components=3),
                    ClassifierSVMPlugin(kernel='rbf'),
                ]),
                F3Pipeline(plugins=[
                    StandardScalerPlugin(),
                    PCAPlugin(n_components=1),
                    ClassifierSVMPlugin(kernel='linear')
                ])
            ]),
        KnnFilter(n_neighbors=2)

    ],
    metrics=[F1(), Precission(), Recall()]
)
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Caching Intermediate Data**
   - The first filter in the `MapReduceFeatureExtractorPipeline` is wrapped with `Cached`.
   - This allows the pipeline to store and reuse intermediate results, improving efficiency for repeated operations.
   - The cache is set to store both data (`cache_data=True`) and the fitted filter (`cache_filter=True`).

2. **Parallel Feature Generation with PySpark**
   - The `MapReduceFeatureExtractorPipeline` utilizes PySpark to process multiple feature extraction pipelines in parallel.
   - Three different feature extraction pipelines are defined:
     a. Cached pipeline with StandardScaler, PCA (2 components), and SVM classifier
     b. Pipeline with StandardScaler, PCA (3 components), and SVM classifier with RBF kernel
     c. Pipeline with StandardScaler, PCA (1 component), and SVM classifier with linear kernel
   - These pipelines will be executed in parallel, each generating a set of features.

3. **Combining Features and Final Classification**
   - The features generated by the parallel pipelines are combined.
   - The combined feature set is then passed to a KNN classifier (`KnnFilter(n_neighbors=2)`).
   - This demonstrates how pipelines can be used as filters within a larger pipeline structure.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - The pipeline is configured with multiple evaluation metrics: F1 score, Precision, and Recall.
   - These metrics will be calculated automatically when the pipeline is evaluated.

## Usage

To use this pipeline:

```python
# Assuming you have your data as x_data and y_data
pipeline.fit(x_data, y_data)
predictions = pipeline.predict(x_test)
evaluation = pipeline.evaluate(x_test, y_test, predictions)
print("Evaluation results:", evaluation)
```

This advanced pipeline showcases the flexibility and power of Framework3, combining caching for efficiency, parallel processing for speed, and stacked models for improved performance.

This markdown file explains the structure and functionality of the complex pipeline you've created. It breaks down the pipeline into its key components and explains how each part contributes to the overall process. This explanation should help users understand how to leverage various features of Framework3 to create sophisticated machine learning workflows.

To include this in your MkDocs documentation, you can add an entry to your `mkdocs.yml` file:

**File: /home/manuel.couto.pintos/Documents/code/framework3/mkdocs.yml**
```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Installation: installation.md
  - Quick Start: quick_start.md
  - Advanced Examples:
    - Complex Pipeline: advanced_pipeline_example.md
  - Api:
      # ... (rest of your API structure)
```

This will add the advanced pipeline example to your documentation, providing users with a more complex use case of Framework3.
