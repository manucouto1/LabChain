## Class Hierarchy
- HPCPipeline

## HPCPipeline
`HPCPipeline` extends `BasePipeline` and provides functionality for executing tasks in parallel, leveraging HPC resources to improve performance and scalability.

### Key Methods:
- `init()`: Initializes the pipeline, setting up necessary resources and configurations for HPC execution.
- `log_metrics()`: Logs relevant metrics during the pipeline's execution to monitor performance and resource utilization.

## Usage Examples

### Creating and Using HPCPipeline
```python
from framework3.plugins.pipelines.parallel.hpc_pipeline import HPCPipeline

# Initialize the HPCPipeline
hpc_pipeline = HPCPipeline()

# Perform necessary setup
hpc_pipeline.init()

# Execute the pipeline
# (Assuming tasks and configurations are defined elsewhere)
hpc_pipeline.execute()

# Log metrics
hpc_pipeline.log_metrics()
```

## Best Practices
1. Ensure that your HPC environment is properly configured and accessible before initializing the pipeline.
2. Define tasks and dependencies clearly to maximize parallel execution efficiency.
3. Monitor resource utilization and adjust configurations as needed to optimize performance.

## Conclusion
`HPCPipeline` provides a robust solution for executing high-performance computing tasks within the `LabChain` ecosystem. By following the best practices and examples provided, you can effectively leverage HPC resources to enhance your machine learning workflows.
