# MapReduceCombinerPipeline

The `MapReduceCombinerPipeline` is a specialized pipeline that leverages the Map-Reduce paradigm to process data in parallel using multiple filters. It extends the `BasePipeline` class and uses PySpark for distributed computing.

## Class Definition

```python
class MapReduceCombinerPipeline(BasePipeline):
    def __init__(self, filters: Sequence[BaseFilter], app_name: str, master: str = "local", numSlices: int = 4):
        # ...
```

## Attributes

- `filters` (Sequence[BaseFilter]): A sequence of filters to be applied in parallel.
- `numSlices` (int): The number of partitions for parallel processing.
- `_map_reduce` (PySparkMapReduce): The PySpark Map-Reduce engine.

## Methods

### `__init__(filters: Sequence[BaseFilter], app_name: str, master: str = "local", numSlices: int = 4)`

Initialize the MapReduceCombinerPipeline.

- `filters`: Sequence of BaseFilter objects to be applied.
- `app_name`: Name of the Spark application.
- `master`: Spark master URL (default is "local").
- `numSlices`: Number of partitions for parallel processing (default is 4).

### `init()`

Initialize the pipeline. Currently a placeholder for future implementation.

### `start(x: XYData, y: XYData | None, X_: XYData | None) -> XYData | None`

Start the pipeline execution.

- `x`: Input data.
- `y`: Target data (optional).
- `X_`: Additional input data for prediction (optional).

Returns the prediction result.

### `fit(x: XYData, y: XYData | None = None)`

Fit all filters in parallel using Map-Reduce.

- `x`: Input data.
- `y`: Target data (optional).

### `predict(x: XYData) -> XYData`

Apply prediction on all filters in parallel and combine the results.

- `x`: Input data for prediction.

Returns the combined prediction results.

### `evaluate(x_data: XYData, y_true: XYData | None, y_pred: XYData) -> Dict[str, Any]`

Evaluate the pipeline. Currently returns an empty dictionary.

### `log_metrics()`

Log metrics. Currently a placeholder for future implementation.

### `finish()`

Finish the pipeline execution and stop the Spark context.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the `MapReduceCombinerPipeline`:

```python
from framework3.plugins.pipelines.map_reduce_pipeline import MapReduceCombinerPipeline
from framework3.base import XYData, BaseFilter

# Define some example filters
class Filter1(BaseFilter):
    def fit(self, x, y):
        # Implement fit logic
        pass

    def predict(self, x):
        # Implement predict logic
        return x  # For simplicity, just return input

class Filter2(BaseFilter):
    def fit(self, x, y):
        # Implement fit logic
        pass

    def predict(self, x):
        # Implement predict logic
        return x * 2  # For example, multiply input by 2

# Create filters
filters = [Filter1(), Filter2()]

# Create MapReduceCombinerPipeline
pipeline = MapReduceCombinerPipeline(filters=filters, app_name="MyMapReduceApp", numSlices=2)

# Create sample data
x = XYData(value=[[1, 2], [3, 4]])
y = XYData(value=[0, 1])

# Run the pipeline
result = pipeline.start(x, y, None)

print(result)  # This will print the combined output of both filters

# Don't forget to finish the pipeline to stop the Spark context
pipeline.finish()
```

This example demonstrates how to create a `MapReduceCombinerPipeline` with custom filters, run it on sample data, and obtain the results. The pipeline will process the filters in parallel using PySpark, which can be particularly useful for large-scale data processing tasks.

Note: Ensure that you have PySpark properly installed and configured in your environment to use this pipeline effectively.
