# Base Abstract Factory Classes

This module provides the foundational abstract factory classes used for implementing dependency injection within the Framework3 project.

## Overview

The abstract factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. In Framework3, this pattern is utilized to enable flexible and extensible dependency injection capabilities.

## Key Components

The main component in this module is:

- `BaseFactory`: A generic factory class for managing and creating pluggable components.

## Usage

The `BaseFactory` class is designed to be subclassed for specific types of components in the framework. It provides methods for registering, retrieving, and managing different types of plugins or components.
