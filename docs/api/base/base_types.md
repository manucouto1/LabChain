# Base types used to move data through the Framework3

This module defines the fundamental data types and structures used throughout the Framework3 project. These types provide a consistent interface for data manipulation and transfer between different components of the framework.

Key types include:

- `XYData`: Represents x-y coordinate data
- `VData`: Represents vector data
- `Float`: A custom float type used throughout the framework

For full details on all types, see the auto-generated documentation below:
