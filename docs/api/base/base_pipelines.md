# BasePipeline

`BasePipeline` is an abstract base class that extends `BaseFilter` and defines the interface for pipeline operations in the Framework3 project. It provides a structure for implementing various types of machine learning pipelines.

## Class Definition

```python
from abc import abstractmethod
from framework3.base.base_clases import BaseFilter
from framework3.base.base_types import XYData
from typing import Optional

class BasePipeline(BaseFilter):
    """
    Base class for implementing pipeline structures in the framework.

    This abstract class extends BaseFilter and defines the interface for pipeline operations.
    Subclasses should implement the abstract methods to provide specific pipeline functionality.
    """
```

## Abstract Methods

### init

```python
@abstractmethod
def init(self) -> None:
    """
    Initialize the pipeline.

    This method should be implemented to perform any necessary setup or initialization
    before the pipeline starts processing data.
    """
```

### start

```python
@abstractmethod
def start(self, x: XYData, y: Optional[XYData], X_: Optional[XYData]) -> Optional[XYData]:
    """
    Start the pipeline processing.

    Args:
        x (XYData): Input data.
        y (Optional[XYData]): Target data, if applicable.
        X_ (Optional[XYData]): Additional input data, if needed.

    Returns:
        Optional[XYData]: Processed data, if any.
    """
```

### log_metrics

```python
@abstractmethod
def log_metrics(self) -> None:
    """
    Log metrics for the pipeline.

    This method should be implemented to record and log any relevant metrics
    during or after pipeline execution.
    """
```

### finish

```python
@abstractmethod
def finish(self) -> None:
    """
    Finish pipeline processing.

    This method should be implemented to perform any necessary cleanup or
    finalization steps after the pipeline has completed its main processing.
    """
```

## Usage

To create a custom pipeline, inherit from `BasePipeline` and implement all the abstract methods. Here's an example:

```python
from framework3.base.base_pipelines import BasePipeline
from framework3.base.base_types import XYData

class MyCustomPipeline(BasePipeline):
    def init(self) -> None:
        # Implement initialization logic
        pass

    def start(self, x: XYData, y: Optional[XYData], X_: Optional[XYData]) -> Optional[XYData]:
        # Implement pipeline start logic
        return processed_data

    def log_metrics(self) -> None:
        # Implement metric logging
        pass

    def finish(self) -> None:
        # Implement pipeline finalization
        pass

    def fit(self, x: XYData, y: Optional[XYData]) -> None:
        # Implement fitting logic
        pass

    def predict(self, x: XYData) -> XYData:
        # Implement prediction logic
        return predictions
```

Note that you also need to implement the `fit` and `predict` methods inherited from `BaseFilter`.

## Inheritance

`BasePipeline` inherits from `BaseFilter`, which means it also includes the abstract methods `fit` and `predict`. Make sure to implement these methods in your custom pipeline classes as well.
