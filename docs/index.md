# Framework3: A Machine Learning Model Development Platform

> **⚠️ Warning**: This project is currently under development and has not been thoroughly tested yet. Use with caution in production environments.

```bash

```



## Purpose

Framework3 is an innovative platform designed to simplify and accelerate the development of machine learning models. Our main goal is to provide data scientists and machine learning engineers with a flexible and powerful tool that allows them to create, experiment with, and deploy models efficiently and in a structured manner.

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is based on three fundamental principles:

1. **Flexibility**: We believe that each machine learning project is unique. That's why Framework3 is designed to be highly adaptable, allowing users to customize every aspect of the model development process.

2. **Modularity**: We have adopted a modular approach that allows users to combine different components easily. This facilitates experimentation and code reuse.

3. **Transparency**: We value clarity and understanding at every step of the machine learning process. Framework3 is designed to provide visibility at all stages, from data preparation to model evaluation.

## Architecture

Framework3 is built on a robust and scalable architecture:

### Main Components

1. **Base**: Includes the base classes and types that serve as the foundation for the entire framework.

2. **Container**: Provides structures to organize and manage the different components of the project.

3. **Plugins**: An extensible system that allows adding new functionalities:
   - Pipelines: For creating complex workflows.
   - Filters: For data transformation and processing.
   - Metrics: For model evaluation.
   - Storage: For efficient management of data and models.

4. **MapReduce**: Facilitates distributed processing to handle large volumes of data.

5. **Utilities**: A set of auxiliary tools for common tasks in model development.
